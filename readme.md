Deployment Notes (Netlify)
Netlify runs functions/app.py as a serverless function.

All routes are redirected through this function via netlify.toml.

The app uses Flask's template system to render pages dynamically.

Roadmap
Add user login (optional)

Support for lap-based scoring

Shareable cup summaries

Export results as CSV

AI Sim Notes
AI finish times are generated based on your result. For example, if you finish 8th, AI times near you (7th, 9th) will be close to yours to maintain realism.
